## Events

In BPMN there are Start events, Intermediate events, and End events. These three event types can be catching events and/or throwing events. Intermediate events can be used as boundary events on tasks, in which case they can be interrupting or non-interrupting. This gives you a lot of flexibility to use events in your processes.

  <strong>Heads up!</strong>
  For understanding the principle behavior of events in BPMN, we recommend to check the
  <a href="http://camunda.org/bpmn/reference.html#events-basic-concepts">Events: Basic Concepts</a> chapter of the <a href="http://camunda.org/bpmn/reference.html">BPMN Modeling Reference</a> section.
