Cycle is already included in the camunda BPM distributions ([Download Area](http://camunda.org/download/)). Just open http://localhost:8080/cycle and create a new Admin User.

Since your process models will be stored in certain repositories, you should set up the respective connectors. In the upper right menu, navigate to "Connectors". Hit the "New"-Button, and follow the steps below depending on what kind of connector you want to set up.

###File Connector

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img id="cycle-file" data-img-thumb src="ref:asset:/assets/img/getting-started/cycle/file.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-9 col-sm-9 col-md-9">
    <p>
      Here is a typical configuration to set up a connector to your local File System. The variable "${user.home}" in this example points to the directory of your user in your Operating System, so if your user is "horst" and you are a Windows-User, this would mean "C:\Users\horst". You can also choose an absolute path like "C:\MyFolder".
    </p>
    <p>
      Hit "Test" to check if Cycle can find the folder you specified.
    </p>
  </div>

###Subversion (SVN) Connector

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img id="cycle-svn" data-img-thumb src="ref:asset:/assets/img/getting-started/cycle/svn.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
    <p>
      When connecting to a Subversion repository, you must specify the URL (including subfolders, if you want to directly point to a certain folder in the Subversion repository). If user credentials are mandatory, you can provide them either globally or individually for each Cycle user. In this example, we assume that every Cycle user will use the same credentials when using this connector, which is why we provide them in this dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hit "Test" to check if Cycle can connect to the SVN repository with the credentials you provided.
