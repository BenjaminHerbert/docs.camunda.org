      With camunda Cycle you can create a roundtrip between a BPMN 2.0 modeler and your Development Repository (SVN, Local File, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      That way, you can use a sophisticated BPMN Design Environment that is especially suitable to your Business Users (Business Analysts, Subject Matter Experts etc.), while keeping the process models created in those tools in sync with the ones that are executed by the camunda process engine.
