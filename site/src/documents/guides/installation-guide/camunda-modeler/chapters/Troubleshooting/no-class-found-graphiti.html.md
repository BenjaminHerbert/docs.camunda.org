  	<p>
    	If you experience NoClassDefFoundErrors like the one shown here, graphiti was not properly installed. Graphiti is a framework used by the <strong>camunda Modeler</strong>. This rarely happens, however it can occur if you had another plug-in installed using  a different version of graphiti before the camunda Modeler (one common example would be the Activiti Designer).

			If this happens you have two options:
			<ul>
	      <li>Start with a <em>fresh</em> Eclipse.</li>
	      <li>Install graphiti manually as shown in the left screenshot (please note that the version might change, currently use the latest 0.8.x version or check which version is referenced in the <strong>camunda Modeler</strong> update site).</li>
      </ul>
