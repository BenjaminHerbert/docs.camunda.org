* We recommend to use Eclipse Indigo. The edition (32bit/64bit) must match your Java edition.
* Please note that you cannot install the Activiti Designer and the camunda Modeler in the same Eclipse. It will cause both designers to not work properly.
* If you are using the fox-designer, please uninstall the fox-designer plugin before using the __camunda Modeler__. You can uninstall already installed plugins in the following menu: `Help` -> `Install New Software...` -> `What is already installed?`.
