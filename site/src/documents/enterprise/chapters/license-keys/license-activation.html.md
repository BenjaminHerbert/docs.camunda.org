      <p>Copy the license key string and paste it into the input box. The following message appears (screenshot on the left) when the license key is valid. Furthermore, you get additional information about your Customer ID and the expiration date.</p>
      <p>The Admin system setting menu offers the possibility to enter additional licenses, for instance when your existing license is expiring and you want to enter a new license key.</p>
      <p>The license key is stored in the database table `ACT_GE_PROPERTY` as *camunda-license-key*. Instead of using the UI input you can also directly place your license key into your database.</p>
